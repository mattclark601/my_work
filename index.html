<h2> Some things about me </h2>
<p> 
    I am from Basking Ridge, NJ and attended Ridge High School. In Fall of 2019 I attended Millersville University, and I have since moved to Norman, Oklahoma in 2020 where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Geographic Information Science with a minor in Meteorology
    at the University of Oklahoma. I will be graduating in Fall '23, with my Bachelors and hope to get a full-time job by the time I graduate in GIS.

GIS and Programming Experience
</h2>
<p>
 
   	I have experience with ArcGIS Pro, Python, R, Javascript,and Microsoft Office including excel. Currently I am a GIS Developer Intern at Innovate! and am learning 
	Javascript and HTML, to develop websites with implementing ArcGIS into HTML. Most of my experience with ArcGIS is with ArcGIS Pro, but I have used ArcMap before. 
	I am experienced with using Arcpy, and using SQL for attribute queries, and am very familiar with all the popular tools that are in Arc GIS Pro.
